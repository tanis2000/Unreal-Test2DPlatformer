# Unreal Engine 5 2D Platformer Project

This is a personal project that I use as testbed for different features for 2D games made with Unreal Engine 5.

I am biased towards C++ code so there's a sparse usage of blueprints over this project. 

## Features

- pixel perfect orthogonal camera
- arcade-style controls (movement, jumps, etc..)
- behavior tree based AI
- navigation mesh
- combat text
- leaderboard
- menus

I'm pretty sure there's more interesting stuff in there, but this is the main content.
